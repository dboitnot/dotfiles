#+TITLE: Dan's Dotfiles

* Introduction

These are the configuration files I use to configure things like Emacs. I use
this repository to keep these configurations in sync across workstations.

I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/html_node/index.html][GNU Stow]] for "dotfile" management.

* Installing Dotfiles

To use this repository, clone it into your home directory. By default, stow will
install packages into its parent directory.

To install a package:

#+begin_src bash
cd dotfiles
stow doom_emacs
#+end_src

The commands above will create the appropriate symlink in the your home
directory.

* DWM

#+begin_src bash
sudo apt-get install dwm suckless-tools xdm dmenu xorg nitrogen
#+end_src
